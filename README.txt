This plugin makes it easy to add Deposits (Pfand) to WooCommerce products.


== Description ==

This plugin was written for a German beverage store. They needed deposits for
bottles as well as boxes, which would be displayed separately and outside of
tax calculations.

With this plugin you can add any deposit to any WooCommerce product by adding
the price under Products - Deposit Types.

*Note:* Because WordPress allows users to add multiple values and
comma-separate them, you have to input the prices with '.' as the decimal
separator , independent of the WooCommerce settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woocommerce-pfand/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Products - Deposit Types and create deposit prices like you would add tags
